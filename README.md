#### We have released the [new JavaScript client](https://www.elastic.co/blog/new-elasticsearch-javascript-client-released)!
*In the next months this client will be deprecated, so you should start migrating your codebase as soon as possible.<br/>
We have built a [migration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/breaking-changes.html) that will help you move to the new client quickly, and if you have questions or need help, please [open an issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js/issues/new/choose).*

## Supported Elasticsearch Versions

Elasticsearch.js provides support for, and is regularly tested against, Elasticsearch releases 0.90.12 and greater. We also test against the latest changes in several branches in the Elasticsearch repository. To tell the client which version of Elastisearch you are using, and therefore the API it should provide, set the `apiVersion` config param. [More info](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/16.x/configuration.html#config-options)

## Examples

Create a client instance
```js
var elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');
var client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  host: 'localhost:9200',
  log: 'trace',
  apiVersion: '7.2', // use the same version of your Elasticsearch instance
});
```

Send a HEAD request to `/` and allow up to 1 second for it to complete.
```js
client.ping({
  // ping usually has a 3000ms timeout
  requestTimeout: 1000
}, function (error) {
  if (error) {
    console.trace('elasticsearch cluster is down!');
  } else {
    console.log('All is well');
  }
});
```

Skip the callback to get a promise back
```js
try {
  const response = await client.search({
    q: 'pants'
  });
  console.log(response.hits.hits)
} catch (error) {
  console.trace(error.message)
}
```

Find tweets that have "elasticsearch" in their body field
```js
const response = await client.search({
  index: 'twitter',
  type: 'tweets',
  body: {
    query: {
      match: {
        body: 'elasticsearch'
      }
    }
  }
})

for (const tweet of response.hits.hits) {
  console.log('tweet:', tweet);
}
```
